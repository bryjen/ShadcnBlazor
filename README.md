## Why another Tailwind Blazor component library?

ShadcnBlazor is built upon the same open source and open code principle as shadcn. Unlike most component libraries, ShadcnBlazor's CLI component allows you to obtain components locally, allowing easy extension and customization. No more need for workarounds when you need a very cusomized component like in other component libraries.

- **Component Ownership** — Components get copied to your machine locally, giving you absolute control.
- **Zero Configuration** — The CLI does everything for you: linking .css/.js, resolving namespaces, addign adding services, etc.
- **Batteries Included** — Pre-compiled CSS included. No Node.js.
