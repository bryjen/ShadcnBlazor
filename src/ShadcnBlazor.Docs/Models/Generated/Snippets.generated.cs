        <AccordionTrigger>What should I pack for a week-long trip?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Start with versatile basics: neutral-colored tops and bottoms that mix and match, one comfortable pair of walking shoes, and layers for changing weather. Pack travel-sized toiletries and consider a capsule wardrobe approach—aim for 5–7 outfits that can be worn in different combinations. Don't forget chargers, adapters for your destination, and any medications. Rolling clothes instead of folding saves space and reduces wrinkles.

        <AccordionTrigger>How do I prepare for airport security?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Arrive at least two hours before domestic flights and three hours for international. Keep liquids under 100ml in a clear, quart-sized bag and place it in an easily accessible pocket. Wear slip-on shoes and minimal jewelry to speed through the metal detector. Have your boarding pass and ID ready before reaching the front of the line. Laptops and large electronics must come out of your bag—consider a TSA-friendly bag to simplify this step.

        <AccordionTrigger>What are the best tips for booking accommodations?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Book early for popular destinations and travel dates, but also check cancellation policies in case your plans change. Read recent reviews rather than just the overall rating—look for mentions of cleanliness, noise, and accuracy of the listing. Compare prices across multiple sites and consider staying slightly outside the main tourist area for better value. If you're flexible, last-minute deals can sometimes save 20–30%, especially for hotels with unsold inventory.

                <AccordionTrigger>How do I get started with the library?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                    Install the package via your preferred method—NuGet, dotnet CLI, or the component installer. Add the necessary service registrations in Program.cs and include the CSS in your layout. The getting started guide walks through a minimal setup in under five minutes. If you're migrating from another UI library, we provide migration notes for common scenarios. Our templates also include pre-configured projects you can use as a starting point.

                <AccordionTrigger>Can I customize the styling to match my brand?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                    Yes. All components use Tailwind CSS and expose a Class parameter for additional styling. You can override CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography to create a consistent theme. The design tokens are documented so you can adjust the look without fighting the framework. For deeper customization, components are built with composition in mind—you can wrap them, extend them, or replace specific parts. Dark mode is supported out of the box via CSS variables.

                <AccordionTrigger>Is the component library accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                    Yes. Components adhere to the WAI-ARIA design patterns and use semantic HTML where appropriate. Keyboard navigation is supported for interactive elements, and focus management is handled for modals, dropdowns, and other overlay components. We recommend testing with screen readers and following the accessibility notes in our documentation. If you encounter an accessibility issue, please report it—we treat a11y as a core requirement, not an afterthought.

        <AccordionTrigger>Can I change or cancel my flight reservation?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Most airlines allow changes or cancellations, but fees and policies vary by fare type. Economy basic tickets often have the strictest rules and may only offer a credit rather than a refund. Flexible or premium fares typically allow free changes within a certain window. Always check your confirmation email for the specific terms—some airlines have waived change fees for certain routes or during promotional periods. If your flight is significantly delayed or cancelled, you may be entitled to compensation under consumer protection laws.

        <AccordionTrigger>What happens if I need to cancel my hotel booking?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Cancellation policies depend on the rate you booked. Non-refundable rates are cheaper but typically don't allow cancellations or offer only partial refunds. Flexible or refundable rates usually let you cancel free of charge up to 24–48 hours before check-in. Some hotels and booking platforms offer ""free cancellation"" as a filter when searching. If you have extenuating circumstances—medical emergency, natural disaster—contact the property directly; many will work with you even when the policy is strict. Consider travel insurance for expensive or non-refundable bookings.

        <AccordionTrigger>Paris &amp; Amsterdam (Available)</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Our most popular combo: start in Paris for the art, architecture, and cuisine, then take the high-speed train to Amsterdam. The journey takes about 3.5 hours. We recommend at least 4 days in Paris and 3 in Amsterdam. Spring and fall offer the best weather and fewer crowds. Book museum tickets in advance—the Louvre and Van Gogh Museum sell out quickly, especially on weekends.

        <AccordionContent>
            Experience the contrast between modern Tokyo and traditional Kyoto. The bullet train between the two cities takes about 2.5 hours. Best visited in spring for cherry blossoms or autumn for fall foliage. We suggest 5 days in Tokyo and 4 in Kyoto. Don't miss the Tsukiji outer market, teamLab Borderless, Fushimi Inari shrine, and a traditional tea ceremony. Consider a Japan Rail Pass if you're also visiting other cities.

    <AccordionItem Value=""item-1"">
        <AccordionTrigger>Can I open multiple items at once?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Yes! Set Type=""AccordionType.Multiple"" on the Accordion component to allow multiple items to be expanded simultaneously. This is useful when you want users to compare content across several sections or keep context from one section visible while reading another. Unlike the default Single mode, opening a new item won't automatically close the one that was previously open.
        </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem Value=""item-2"">
        <AccordionTrigger>How does the toggle behavior work?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Each item can be toggled independently. Clicking an open item will collapse it; clicking a closed item will expand it. There's no limit to how many items can be open at the same time—you could have all of them expanded if that suits your use case. This makes the Multiple mode ideal for FAQ pages, settings panels, or any content where users might want to reference several sections at once.
        </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem Value=""item-3"">
        <AccordionTrigger>Can I close all items so nothing is expanded?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Yes. In Multiple mode, you can expand and collapse any combination of items, including having none open. Users can close each item individually by clicking its trigger, and there's no requirement to keep at least one section expanded. This gives you full flexibility for both the initial state and how users interact with the accordion over time.
