        <AccordionTrigger>Can I change or cancel my flight reservation?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Most airlines allow changes or cancellations, but fees and policies vary by fare type. Economy basic tickets often have the strictest rules and may only offer a credit rather than a refund. Flexible or premium fares typically allow free changes within a certain window. Always check your confirmation email for the specific terms—some airlines have waived change fees for certain routes or during promotional periods. If your flight is significantly delayed or cancelled, you may be entitled to compensation under consumer protection laws.

        <AccordionTrigger>What happens if I need to cancel my hotel booking?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Cancellation policies depend on the rate you booked. Non-refundable rates are cheaper but typically don't allow cancellations or offer only partial refunds. Flexible or refundable rates usually let you cancel free of charge up to 24–48 hours before check-in. Some hotels and booking platforms offer "free cancellation" as a filter when searching. If you have extenuating circumstances—medical emergency, natural disaster—contact the property directly; many will work with you even when the policy is strict. Consider travel insurance for expensive or non-refundable bookings.
