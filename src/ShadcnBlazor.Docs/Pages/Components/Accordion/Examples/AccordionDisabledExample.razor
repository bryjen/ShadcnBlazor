        <AccordionTrigger>Paris &amp; Amsterdam (Available)</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Our most popular combo: start in Paris for the art, architecture, and cuisine, then take the high-speed train to Amsterdam. The journey takes about 3.5 hours. We recommend at least 4 days in Paris and 3 in Amsterdam. Spring and fall offer the best weather and fewer crowds. Book museum tickets in advance—the Louvre and Van Gogh Museum sell out quickly, especially on weekends.

        <AccordionTrigger>Tokyo &amp; Kyoto (Available)</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Experience the contrast between modern Tokyo and traditional Kyoto. The bullet train between the two cities takes about 2.5 hours. Best visited in spring for cherry blossoms or autumn for fall foliage. We suggest 5 days in Tokyo and 4 in Kyoto. Don't miss the Tsukiji outer market, teamLab Borderless, Fushimi Inari shrine, and a traditional tea ceremony. Consider a Japan Rail Pass if you're also visiting other cities.
