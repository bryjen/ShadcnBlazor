        <AccordionTrigger>What should I pack for a week-long trip?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Start with versatile basics: neutral-colored tops and bottoms that mix and match, one comfortable pair of walking shoes, and layers for changing weather. Pack travel-sized toiletries and consider a capsule wardrobe approach—aim for 5–7 outfits that can be worn in different combinations. Don't forget chargers, adapters for your destination, and any medications. Rolling clothes instead of folding saves space and reduces wrinkles.

        <AccordionTrigger>How do I prepare for airport security?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Arrive at least two hours before domestic flights and three hours for international. Keep liquids under 100ml in a clear, quart-sized bag and place it in an easily accessible pocket. Wear slip-on shoes and minimal jewelry to speed through the metal detector. Have your boarding pass and ID ready before reaching the front of the line. Laptops and large electronics must come out of your bag—consider a TSA-friendly bag to simplify this step.

        <AccordionTrigger>What are the best tips for booking accommodations?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Book early for popular destinations and travel dates, but also check cancellation policies in case your plans change. Read recent reviews rather than just the overall rating—look for mentions of cleanliness, noise, and accuracy of the listing. Compare prices across multiple sites and consider staying slightly outside the main tourist area for better value. If you're flexible, last-minute deals can sometimes save 20–30%, especially for hotels with unsold inventory.
